Smart contract
A smart contract is a digital contract written as a piece of code, stored on the blockchain, and automatically executed when certain pre-established conditions are met. 

Smart Contract holds several similarities with a normal contract but is a digital contract with a bit of added functionalities. It is an assortment of agreements that are stored on a blockchain as codes. They are set up with pre-arranged conditions and these contracts automatically execute only if the conditions are met. A Smart Contract once set up cannot be hampered or meddled.

In addition to it, Smart Contracts being stored on a blockchain make it near impossible to tamper with. So if you’re thinking that a hacker will meddle with it, don’t worry, no hacker in their right minds will alter the contract on the blockchain. So Smart Contracts are safe and unalterable.
